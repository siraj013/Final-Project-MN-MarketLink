- MN MarketLink

MN MarketLink is a dynamic web application that connects Minnesota’s local farmers with their communities. The goal is to make it easier for people to discover nearby farmers markets, learn about local vendors, and pre-order fresh produce for pickup — all in one simple platform.

- What It Does

Browse all farmers markets across Minnesota

View vendors attending each market and their product offerings

Pre-order items online for quick and easy pickup

Track orders and transactions in real-time

- How It Works

The system uses a relational database to organize and connect data between markets, vendors, products, customers, orders, and transactions.

Markets host multiple vendors

Vendors offer different products

Customers place orders that generate transactions

- Tech Overview

Frontend: React (or your chosen frontend framework)

Backend: Node.js / Express

Database: MySQL (or any relational DB)

Entity Relationships: Defined using ERD (Market, Vendor, Product, Customer, Order, Transaction)

- Vision

MN MarketLink empowers local farmers, supports sustainable agriculture, and strengthens the bond between communities and their food sources.
